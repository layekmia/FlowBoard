# 🖥️ Kanban Board Frontend

This is the **frontend application** for the Kanban Task Management system.  
It provides a beautiful drag-and-drop interface to manage tasks across **Todo**, **Progress**, and **Completed** columns.  
Built with **React.js**, it integrates with the backend API to store boards and tasks.

## 🧪 Features in Detail

### 1. Create a Board

* Click the **"Add Board"** button.
* Provide a board name and select a color.
* Board will be saved in localStorage (or backend if connected).

### 2. Add a Task

* Click the **`+`** button in any column (Todo/Progress/Completed).
* Fill the task title in the modal.
* Task will be added to the respective column.

### 3. Drag & Drop Tasks

* Drag a task card from one column to another.
* The task status updates automatically.
* The column dynamically **expands and collapses** while dragging.

### 4. Delete Tasks

* Click the delete (🗑️) icon to remove a task.
* The UI updates instantly.

---

## 🖱️ Drag-and-Drop Explanation

We use **@dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop functionality:

* `useDraggable` → Makes a task draggable.
* `useDroppable` → Makes each column a drop zone.
* When a task is dragged over a column, that column **expands** dynamically.
* On drop, the task status updates and is saved to localStorage or backend.

---

## 📌 API Integration

If you are connected to the backend:

* Boards and tasks are synced with **MongoDB**.
* API Endpoints:

  * `GET /api/boards` → Fetch boards
  * `POST /api/boards` → Create a new board
  * `POST /api/boards/:boardId/tasks` → Add a task
  * `PATCH /api/boards/:boardId/tasks/:taskId` → Update task status
  * `DELETE /api/boards/:boardId/tasks/:taskId` → Delete a task

For now, the frontend also supports **localStorage mode** for offline usage.
